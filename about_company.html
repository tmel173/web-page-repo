<H1>About Us</H1>


`A contract manufacturing (CM) company that manufactures electronic circuit boards for large OEMs (Original Equipmant Manufacturers). The OEMs design the hardware and circuits, and the CMs build the boards using the desighns provided. The CMs use stat0of-the-art manufactring assembly techiques which include automated assembly lines where machines place phe parts on pr-printed curcuit boards, send them through ovens where the parts are soldered to the boards, and wash the borads after they are soldered. The pprocess involves set ups of the placement machines for each board: programmin the profiles of the "ovens" so the temperatures are appropriate for the boards come off the leines, theyt are tested using Automated Test equipmant. Falures are trachked and brought to an in-hose Failure Analysis lab to determine why the parts are failing and to determine where in the process problans might be occurring.
